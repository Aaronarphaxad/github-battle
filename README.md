# Github Battle

Web app used to check the popularity of repos according to the language and also for github users to battle each other for popularity. This was built with react and tailwindcss.

## What I learnt building this

- Solidified my knowledge on react hooks, and lifecycle methods with useState and useEffect.
- Built dark mode toggle feature on my own. Very proud of myself :)
- Built hamburger menu feature which works on smaller screens.
- Learned about some javascript method I haven't used before like reduce, Promise.all, sort, ternary operators, throwing new errors, e.t.c.
- Learned more about tailwind and debugging CSS. Along with CSS tricks.
- Learned more about fetching data from API and handling asynchronous programming using fetch. Promises and catching errors.
- Understood functional programming a lot better. And also when to use class based or functional components.
